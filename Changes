Revision history for Test-Continuous

0.76:
- Fix the crash when running under a non-git dir. (Joelle Maslak)++
- Add "--autoprove-skip-initial" CLI arg to skip the initial test (Joelle Maslak)++
- Fix: `autoprove <dir>` now works as it is supposed to be. (Sean Zellmer)++

0.75:
- Use .gitignore to build exclude list if it exists. (Sean Zellmer)++
- better suppport for Test::Class-based tests. (Nelo Onyiah)++

0.74:
- Fix it for perl 5.18.

0.73:
- Ignore a lot more known boring files. Specifically Komodo project files. See RT #74670.

0.72:
- Now need 'autoprove -b' to build. In many cases, '-l' is sufficient.
- '-b' and '-l' args are also populated to the underlying invocation to "prove".
- Use system() instead to help preventing stucking in the middle of tests

0.71:
- let "autoprove <prove args>" run all tests instead of no tests at all.
- fix typos

0.70:
- remove the use of Exporter::Lite in favor of using 'autoprove' command.
- Fix RT 66822: exclude vim swap files.

0.69:
- If the current dir can be built with 'make' or "Build.PL", it'll be built before running tests. Closes RT #52159 and RT #52160. Thanks to Michael G Schwern for providing the suggestions and patches.

0.68:
- Closes RT: 52158. Monitor virtually all files.
  .git and .svn directories are ignored, as long as vim and emacs temp files.
- Closes RT: 50286. Thanks Yusuke Watase for providing the patch.

0.67:
- use File::ChangeNotify to watch changed files because it is much faster than
  linux. Thanks to dann++

0.66:
- fix the massive warning coming from File::Modified.

0.65:
- Support TAP::Harness::Remote

0.64:
- now ship with an "autoprove" program as the runner.
- documentation updates

0.63:
- refactor of previous release such that it does not
  require an TAP Archive class to work.
  This is better in general since some harness classes
  do not work with archive easily.
- therefore, remove a few modules from the dependency list

0.62:
- Fix dependencies

0.61:
- Make runtests function delegate unused @ARGV to App::Prove

0.60:
- Report comments in TAP output. So diag or dubious test file can be seen.
- code refactoring.
- Finally some meaningful tests for Test-Continuous!

0.0.5:
- Fix the case that it runs the whole t/ directory if there's
  no subset of tests to run from dependency list. It should only
  run those tests given in the command line.

0.0.4:
- Fix dependency list again. (Grr)

0.0.3:
- [Fix] The growl icon is only working for the first time.
- Accept test files as arguments
- Auto detect the subset of tests to run.

0.0.2:
- Sun Feb 17 00:55:03 CST 2008
- [Growl] Use different icon for reporting FAIL.
- Fix dependency. :(

0.0.1  Sat Feb 16 14:09:02 2008
