NAME
    Test::Continuous - Run your test suite continuously when developing.

VERSION
    This document describes Test::Continuous version 0.61

SYNOPSIS
    Very simple usage:

        % cd MyModule/
        % perl -MTest::Continuous -e runtests

    If you want to provide prove arguments:

        % perl -MTest::Continuous -e runtests -- --shuffle

DESCRIPTION
    *Continuous Testing* is a concept and tool to re-run software tests as
    soon as the developer saves the source code.

    See also <http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/continuoustesting/> for the
    original implementation of Continuous Testing as an Eclipse plugin.

    See also Zentest <http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/> for
    the same concept implemented in Ruby's world.

INTERFACE
    runtests
        This is the only function that you should be calling, directly from
        command line:

            perl -MTest::Continuous -e runtests

        It'll start monitoring the mtime of all files under current working
        directy. If there's any update, it'll run your module test under t/
        directory with App::Prove.

        Test result are displayed on terminal. Also dispatched to Growl if
        "Log::Dispatch::MacGrowl" is installed. Big plus for perl
        programmers on Mac.

        "Test::Continuous" will auto detect the subset of tests to run. For
        example, say you have two test files "feature-foo.t" and
        "feature-bar.t" which test, and use, your module "Feature::Foo" and
        "Feature::Bar" respectively. "Test::Continuous" can catch this
        static dependency and only run "feature-foo.t" when "Feature::Foo"
        is modified, "feature-bar.t" will only be ran if "Feature::Bar" is
        modified.

        If a ".t" file is modified, only that test file will be ran.

        Dynamic module dependency is more difficult to detect and needs
        further research.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    Test::Continuous requires no configuration files or environment
    variables.

DEPENDENCIES
    App::Prove, Log::Dispatch, Log::Dispatch::MacGrowl, Module::ExtractUse

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    No bugs have been reported.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "bug-test-continuous@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org>.

TODO
    A good name for executable.
    Accept a per-module config file to tweak different parameters to prove
    command.
