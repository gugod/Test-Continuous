=head1 NAME

Test::Continuous - Run your test suite continuously when developing.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Test::Continuous version 0.68

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Very simple usage:

    % cd MyModule/
    % autoprove

You may pass prove arguments:

    % autoprove --shuffle

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<Continuous Testing> is a concept and tool to re-run software tests
as soon as the developer saves the source code.

C<Test::Continuous> is a tool based on L<App::Prove> that implements
this concept for Perl.

See L<http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/continuoustesting/> for the
original implementation of Continuous Testing as an Eclipse plugin.
See also Zentest L<http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/> for
the same concept implemented in Ruby's world.

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item runtests

This function starts monitoring the mtime of all files under current
working directory. If there's any update, it runs your module tests
under t/ directory with L<App::Prove>.

You could call it from command line like this:

    perl -MTest::Continuous -e Test::Continuous::runtests

However, it's recommended to use the L<autoprove> program shipped with
this distribution to do this instead.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Test::Continuous requires no configuration files or environment variables.

Your C<.proverc> is NOT loaded, even though it's based on L<App::Prove>.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<App::Prove>, L<Log::Dispatch>, L<Log::Dispatch::DesktopNotification>,
L<Module::ExtractUse>

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

It might not be compatible with all Test::Harness::* classes. Testing with
remote harness classes basically works, but has some glitches. Help is
appreciated.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-test-continuous@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
