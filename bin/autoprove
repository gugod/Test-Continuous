=head1 NAME

autoprove - automatically prove your application with tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Simply run this command and leave it in the foreground:

  $ autoprove

You may add a few 'prove' options:

  $ autoprove --shuffle --fork

And/or specify only the test programs that you want to run automatically:

  $ autoprove t/mytest.t t/another.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is a CLI front-end to the module L<Test::Continuous>. It is basically
the equivalent of running:

    perl -MTest::Continuous -e Test::Continuous::runtests

But simpler.

Test results are displayed on terminal.  If
L<Log::Dispatch::DesktopNotification> is installed, test results will
also be notified through that channel. If running on Mac, it'll be
Growl, if it's on Linux desktop, it's done with
L<Log::Dispatch::Gtk2::Notify>.

C<Test::Continuous> will auto detect the subset of tests to run.
For example, say you have two test files C<feature-foo.t> and
C<feature-bar.t> which test, and use, your module C<Feature::Foo>
and C<Feature::Bar> respectively. C<Test::Continuous> can catch
this static dependency and only run C<feature-foo.t> when C<Feature::Foo>
is modified, C<feature-bar.t> will only be run if C<Feature::Bar>
is modified.

If a C<.t> file is modified, only that test file will be run.
