=head1 NAME

autoprove - automatically prove your application with tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Simply run this command and leave it in the foreground:

  $ autoprove

You may add a few 'prove' options:

  $ autoprove --shuffle --fork

And/or specify only the test programs that you want to run automatically:

  $ autoprove t/mytest.t t/another.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is a CLI front-end to the module L<Test::Continuous>. It is basically
equivalent of running:

    perl -MTest::Continuous -e runtests

But simpler.
